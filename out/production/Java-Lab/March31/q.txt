Write a program in java to create two classes such as TwoDArray and OneDArray.

Members of TwoDArray class are:

a) One 2D array
b) Constructor to allocate memory of size (2 x n) for the array
c) input data into the array
d) display the array elements row wise
e) Split the array into two different arrays and store them in the array variable in two different objects of class OneDArray.
f) Add the arrays (m x n matrices) of two objects of TwoDArray class
g) Multiply the arrays (m x n matrices) of two objects of TwoDArray class

Members of OneDArray class are:

a) One 1D Array
b) Constructor to allocate memory of size (n) as the column size of TwoDArray class
c) Show the array


Modify the above program to create same (m) no of array of objects of OneDArray as the no of rows available in the array (m x n) of TwoDArray. Then add another method in TwoDArray class that can distribute all rows of the 2D array of TwoDArray class into each object of OneDArray class.
