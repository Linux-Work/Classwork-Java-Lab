Write a menu driven program in java using JDBC to Insert, Delete, Search and view all records from a student table that you have created. Note: Before implementing this code to connect to Oracle database you should create an empty table "student" in oracle having 3 columns such as: create table student (id number(3), name varchar2(30), fees number(7,2)).



::::StudentDatabase::::

In this program, we have created a StudentDatabase class with a main method. Inside the main method, we have established a connection to the Oracle database using JDBC.

We have then implemented a while loop to display a menu and take user input for various operations like insert, delete, search and view records.

For each operation, we have defined separate methods like insertRecord, deleteRecord, searchRecord and viewAllRecords.

In the insertRecord method, we have taken input from the user for ID, name and fees of the student. We have then used a prepared statement to insert these values into the "student" table in the database.

In the deleteRecord method, we have taken input from the user for ID of the student whose record needs to be deleted. We have then used a prepared statement to delete this record from the "student" table in the database.

In the searchRecord method, we have taken input from the user for ID of the student whose record needs to be searched. We have then used a prepared statement to select this record from the "student" table in the database. If found, we print it on console otherwise print "Record not found".

In the viewAllRecords method, we have used a prepared statement to select all records from the "student" table in the database. We have then printed them on console.
